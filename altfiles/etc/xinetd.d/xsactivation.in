# This is the configuration for the xs-activation server
# The service, as described by C. Scott Ananian
# * It listens on port 191 on those addresses on all interfaces.
# * When it receives a connection, it reads exactly 11 bytes.
# * It checks its "database" (text file, directory, in-memory hash) to
#   see if it has an activation lease for the serial number given by those
#   11 bytes.  If so, it sends it.
# * It closes the connection.
