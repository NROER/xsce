This is the default configuration for the OLPC XS/XSX school server, described in greater detail below. Don't ever install this if you don't understand what it is!

to rpmbuild:

1.) Never rpmbuild as root.
2.) Set your rpm target directory in ./setup-rpm
3.) Run ./setup-rpm
4.) The package shows up in $rpm/RPMS/noarch



*What Is This?*
   This package installs OLPC-default configurations for an XS/XSX school server over existing configurations. It will bash RPM-default configurations, but not user-modified configurations. It tries to make backups wherever possible. Backups are named *.olpcsave or *.olpcnew, and follow the same logic as RPM backups.

   The directory fsroot.olpc.img contains the configuration tree root image to install. You can easily generate a configuration tree root image on an existing machine by running the script get-configtree.py . You can also edit the tree by hand.

   When the package is installed, fsroot.olpc.img gets copied into the root directory of the target machine. It then recursively symlinks the image to the root directory, using the script symlink_tree.py . On uninstall, the package recursively unlinks the image and root directory using the script unlink_tree.py . 

   Obviously, installing this package can potentially be dangerous and *very destructive* to existing configurations.

*So Why?*

   The intention of this package is to be installed on OLPC XS/XSX liveCD builds, as an "alternative default" configuration. It is *much* easier to maintain and experiment with the configuration tree than it is with postscripts. It is also much easier to locate OLPC-specific configuration files post-install when they are contained in a centralized directory.
