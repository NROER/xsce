start from a current make of master
"make rpm" leaves a clean copy of the build tree in ./build/BUILDROOT/xs-conf*
go to this tree, do a "find . > tree" to get the structure
import this in excel, and add a colum for each file indicating which plugin it belongs in
cut this excel, and paste it into a textedit file (which uses RS=^M
cat this map of <files to plugin name> into "xsc_tools tree2pluginds.d"
(this creates the manifest, and copies the files themselver into files directory)
create the Makefiles "xsc_tools mkmake"
make -d rpm > temp
