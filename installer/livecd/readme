In the open terminal type: sudo xsceinst

Proceed through the guided prompts

Click partitioning and then click on "done "

Click on "begin installation"

Should you want to create another user please do not use "xsce-admin" as a new user, that one is already occupied.

Notes:

Please refrain from using liveinst during testing, tring to implement that functionality in the future, but if you're brave try "xsceinst" at the bootprompt.
