# Configuration file for the httpd service.

#
# The default processing model (MPM) is the process-based
# 'prefork' model.  A thread-based model, 'worker', is also
# available, but does not work with some modules (such as PHP).
# The service must be stopped before changing this variable.

# Choose a config file depending on memory
#MEMSIZE=$(grep '^MemTotal' /proc/meminfo | grep -oP '\d+')
#OPTIONS=" -f conf/httpd-xs.conf -DMEM256m "
# Note: the sizes are rounded to a lower value
#       as they are usually reported a tad lower than the
#       "proper" MB value in bytes (video cards often steal RAM!).

# To pass additional options (for instance, -D definitions) to the
# httpd binary at startup, set OPTIONS here.

# By default, the httpd process is started in the C locale; to 
# change the locale in which the server runs, the HTTPD_LANG
# variable can be set.
