#  This is a bonding interface, which represents what we want to do
#  if eth1 (the LAN NIC) is present. If the NIC is present, it will
#  associate to this device and all will be happy. If it is not,
#  then the address and routing will be in place anyway, making the
#  software that wants to bind to it happy.
#
#  See /usr/share/doc/xs-config-*/README.networking on how and why
#  we use bonded interfaces.
